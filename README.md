Modern, efficient menu for the MATE Desktop Environment.

![screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/solus-project/brisk-menu/master/.github/Brisk_Menu_0.3.0.png)

This project is currently in very early stages, and as such is under very heavy development. The primary motivation is to provide a very usable menu, as seen in other desktops, but without the bloat and/or performance problems that plague current offerings.

This project is being spearheaded by Solus, as a *collaborative* effort between the various MATE communities (chiefly, Ubuntu MATE) to reinvigorate the MATE Desktop with modern, first-class options. As such, Brisk Menu is a **distro-agnostic** desktop. Please ensure to report any issues of non portability!

brisk-menu is a [Solus project](https://solus-project.com/).

Building Brisk Menu
-------------------

 * Please ensure you have GTK 3.18 *minimum*
 * Please ensure you are using a GTK 3.18 build of MATE 1.16 or newer

```bash
    ./autogen.sh --prefix=/usr
    make -j$(($(getconf _NPROCESSORS_ONLN)+1))
    sudo make install
````

Features
--------

Currently, very lacking! Remember, it's still in early development.

 - Keyboard centric (mice welcome too, of course)
 - Hotkey support (defaults to <kbd>CTRL+F10</kbd>, configurable in gsettings)
 - Stupid-fast
 - Efficient, useful searching.
 - Automatically reload
 - Filter via categories
 - Session/screensaver controls
 - Drag & drop support for launchers
 - GTK3
 - Fully correct `X11` WM integration (grab policy and window types)
 - Not Python.

**Planned**

Some items that are currently known to be definite options in the roadmap:

 - Persistent storage of settings ✓
 - Option to disable category icons for modern look
 - Configurable menu button icon + label on applet
 - 'Favourite' item capability
 - Improved styling for the window edge + search entry.

More will be added in time as we go along.
